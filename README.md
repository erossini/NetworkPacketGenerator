# Network Packet Generator for Python

You are required to create a network packet generator in Python version 3.x that supports multiple protocols (at least three) and integrates encryption and a graphical user interface (GUI).

Use libraries such as scapy to: 

1. Create and send packets with custom headers (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP). Include options to specify packet attributes (e.g., source IP, destination IP, port). Ensure that you use separate threads for each instance of the packet transmission.
2. Add a GUI for selecting traffic type and starting traffic generation.
3. Implement option to encrypt the data payload of a packet.
